# Generative_Model

## Overview

### VAE
Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are a type of generative model that combines principles from both variational inference and autoencoders. VAEs are particularly useful for generating new data samples that are similar to the data on which they were trained.

### Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are another popular class of generative models. GANs consist of two neural networks, the **generator** and the **discriminator**, which are trained simultaneously in a game-theoretic framework:

- **Generator**: Creates synthetic data samples from random noise. The goal of the generator is to produce data that is indistinguishable from real data.
- **Discriminator**: Evaluates whether the data samples are real (from the training set) or fake (generated by the generator). The discriminator's goal is to correctly classify data as real or fake.

The generator and discriminator compete against each other, leading to the generator improving its ability to produce realistic samples and the discriminator improving its ability to distinguish between real and generated data. GANs are widely used in tasks such as image synthesis, data augmentation, and more.
