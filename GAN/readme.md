# Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for ECG Data

## Overview

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a class of machine learning frameworks designed to generate new data samples that resemble a given dataset. 
A GAN consists of two neural networks, the **generator** and the **discriminator**, which compete against each other to improve the model's performance. 
The generator creates data samples, while the discriminator evaluates them, guiding the generator to produce increasingly realistic samples.

In this repository, I'll explore how to implement a GAN to generate ECG (Electrocardiogram) data. 
ECG data is used to monitor the electrical activity of the heart, and generating realistic ECG signals can be useful for various medical and research applications.
